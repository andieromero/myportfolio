My roles were the primary UI/UX designer and a member on the front-end development team. I built the UI using Bootstrap and the front-end framework using AngularJS. The web app consumes public available datasets from open.fda.gov about drugs and adverse events to provide users with important information about reactions.",

With the growing client base, their website at the time was not at the Google SEO's standards, and more importantly, was not user friendly. I redesigned and developed their studio website to showcase their music teachers, a new brand, and reduce their content to the necessities. The website is now more readible, integrated with their facebook site, and much easier to maintain for the manager.",

The main objective of this assignment was to create useful meaning from Delphi's public dataset and to provide interactive visualization of the information. ",

The website plays off of a futuristic utopian school system. It is presented as if it has already happened. The website demonstrates the three different phases our ideal school would have. It also provides a google doc where students can voice their own questions about the current educational structure. ",
